title:  "Me and Python"

# Hello and welcome!

This was not my first experience with python I had learned python on my own on the side during my job on and off for the last 3 years hoping to get better at it but never had good enough discipline or consistency to be able to become an expert user at it. 

Python can be used for a variety of things, but best used for data science. Python is also considered an "easy" programming language to learn so it is also used for educational purposes. I personally like python.

Some positives of using python is that it is pretty easy to read the code as it somewhat straight forward. Other positives is that it has a lot of different open source libraries that people create for use so python is capable of many things.

Python's negatives would be that it is too literal. By that I mean, the indentation and order of the code has to be almost perfect to do the things you want it to do. It also may not be the most powerful programming language to use in certain areas compared to Javascript being very well used for web development.
