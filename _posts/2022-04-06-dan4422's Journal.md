# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Web Development Blog.

The question is where do I see myself at the end of my 16-week web development bootcamp journey and at the end of 6 months and at the end of 1 year. For myself, at the end of the bootcamp in 16 weeks I see myself still learning more about coding and development while hopefully having a software engineering or development job. After 6 months, I'm probably still learning even more but having a better grasp on what I need to do to be able to create the things I want or I need for the job. After 1 year, I see myself being a competent developer who only needs google and developing websites or programs i'm interested in while also helping others to code. I'm honestly pretty excited, eager and scared. Excited that I get to continuously keep learning and becoming better at something. Scared that I might fall behind but eager to know that I am getting into something that will help my future and be considered relevant for the future.

I hope to be an aspiring developer/coder who also does it for fun sometimes because it interests me. Potential roadblocks for me would be letting myself get complacent and not continuously learning to code or practicing my skills!

For my instructor, Lachlan Heywood, all I ask is you keep me accountable for the next 15 weeks!
